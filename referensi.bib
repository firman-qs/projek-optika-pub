  abstract  = "In recent years, smartphones have become the main computing tool
               for most of the population, making them an ideal tool in many
               areas. Most of these smartphones are equipped with cutting-edge
               hardware on their digital cameras, sensors and processors. For
               this reason, this paper discusses the possibility of using
               smartphones as an accessible and accurate tool, focusing on the
               measurement of light, which is an element that has a high impact
               on human behavior, which promotes conformance and safety, or
               alters human physiology when it is inappropriate. To carry out
               this study, three different ways to measure light through
               smartphones have been checked: the ambient light sensor, the
               digital camera and an external Bluetooth luxmeter connected with
               the smartphone. As a result, the accuracy of these methods has
               been compared to check if they can be used as accurate
               measurement tools.",
